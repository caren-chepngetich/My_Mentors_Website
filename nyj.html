       <h1> Summary Of The First Two Chapters In Born A Crime</h1>

“Born a Crime” talks about Trevor Noah’s journey. The racial injustices and inequality in South Africa.
 The Immorality Act of 1927, was a South African law that criminalized sexual relationships between whites
 and people of color leading to racial tensions and discrimination. Noah's mum ran away from home to live 
 and work in Johannesburg. She hid as it was illegal for Black people to live in the city.

He addresses racial injustice and inequality. Before apartheid, South Africans were divided into tribes. 
The Zulu and the Xhosa had conflicts. Trevor’s mother was a devout Christian. Xhosa women were seen as 
prostitutes and when Noah was traveling with his mom, a bus driver criticized her for traveling with 
children without a man late at night.

<h1>How the issues connect</h1>
In Uasin Gishu County, tribalism is a challenge as one tribe is favored, and given jobs and resources. 
Single mothers are judged in society for not having a man and are viewed as immoral by many.
In the society, women are religious. They attend church on Sundays and have fellowships, women’s day, 
and weekly meetings. Most of the time they move from one church to another. They believe that Each church 
offers something different.Insecurity is addressed as many people don’t have a source of income. Matatu and 
Uber drivers are at times involved in crimes and attack their passengers. They fight over customers and use 
vulgar language when addressing each other.
